netbox-netprod-importer is a tool dedicated to help moving your current
knowledge base to `Netbox <https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ as an
IPAM/DCIM, independently of your current information system. It connects to
a given list of network devices, parse their status and configuration to
import them into Netbox like they are currently configured.

It is thought to be generic and infrastructure agnostic. It means that imported
data will probably need to be adapted by some custom scripts, like the
specification of roles, tennant and other properties on objects.


Used by `Online.net <https://www.online.net>`_ on more than 5000 network
devices.
